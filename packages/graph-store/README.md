[SPARQL Graph Store Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/) support for Linked Data pipelines.

This package provides operations to read and write from a SPARQL Graph Store.

## Operations

The operation names match the HTTP methods in lower case.

### get ({ endpoint, graph, user, password})

This operation reads a named graph from the given SPARQL Graph Store.

  The default graph will be read if an empty string is given or the option is not given at all.
- `user`: User for basic authentication.
- `password`: Password for basic authentication.

### post ({ endpoint, user, password})

A `Writable` stream of RDF/JS `Quad` objects is returned.
The following options are supported:

- `endpoint`: The URL of the graph store endpoint as a string.
- `user`: User for basic authentication.
- `password`: Password for basic authentication.
